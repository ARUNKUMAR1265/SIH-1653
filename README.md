## Problem Title
SIH 1653: AI-based Traffic Management System
## Problem Description
An AI-Based Traffic Management System optimizes traffic flow using real-time data, machine learning, and automation. It dynamically controls signals, predicts congestion, detects incidents, and provides alternate routes to reduce delays and enhance road safety. By integrating with IoT devices and smart vehicles, it improves urban mobility, lowers emissions, and enhances commuter experience, making cities smarter and more efficient.
